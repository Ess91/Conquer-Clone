# Conquer-Clone

The "Conquer" Website Template is a project in learning how to create a modern CSS looking web app in HTML/CSS/JS without the Bootstrap, jQuery, or other libraries. This website clone is perfect for businesses as well as those wanting to start a blog.

## Prerequisites

Some understanding of HTML/CSS & Javascript

## Installation

Fork: Producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. *(Source: Github Guides)*

1. Fork the Conquer-Clone repo
   Either do this by:

   1. Downloading the file as a zip folder - Downloading the zip folder onto your personal computer and extracting it from there
   1. Download it through the Github CLI - More information on [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/)


   Once you've found a suitable folder on your local computer for your forked repository, you can now customise it and make it your own.
